                  What are the minimum system requirements for LEGO Racers?</font><br>
                  <b>A.</b> The Minimum System Requirements are as follows:<br>
                  <li> Win 95/98 only (not compatible with Windows NT, OS/2, Linux 
                    or any Windows emulated operating systems.<br>
                  <li>100% DirectX 6.1 compatible system (DirectX 6.1 included 
                    on LEGO Racers CD)<br>
                  <li>Pentium 166 MHz (Pentium 200 MHz or faster recommended; also compatible with AMD-K6-2, 
                    AMD-K6-III and Cyrix MII processors)<br>

                  <li> 4x speed or faster CD-ROM or DVD drive<br>
                  <li> 210 MB uncompressed hard disk space<br>
                  <li>4 MB Direct3D compatible graphics accelerator card (PCI 
                    or AGP) <br>
                  <li>16-bit DirectSound compatible sound card <br>
                  <li>Mouse <br>
                  <li>Joystick/game pad recommended but not required <br>
                    <br>
                    Note- The most common issues with any game is that the drivers 
                    your computer's graphics card and sound card are using are 
                    out of date or not fully compatible with DirectX. For 
                    more information on this please see the DirectX section. <br>

                    </font> <b>A.</b> On many (but not all) computers this is caused by virtual swapping 
                     - when the PC 
                    accesses the hard disk to exchange information. This is unfortunately 
                    incurable; however, it will only affect the video clips, not 
                    the game itself.<br>

                    Find the shortcut for LEGO RACERS and right-click on it. From

                    a menu will appear allowing you to choose your graphics card. 
                    Under DEVICE choose MICROSOFT D3D HARDWARE ACCELERATION.<br>

                    </font> <b>A.</b> First we should uninstall LEGO Racers completely 
                    from the system. Follow the instructions below to uninstall

                    click YES. Once it is through uninstalling you will need to 
                    click OK to close the uninstall shield wizard.<br>
                  <li>Insert the CD into the CD-Drive and the auto install should 
                    begin. You will want to be sure to install DXMEDIA and DirectX 
                    6.1 when it asks.<br>
                  <li>Close down any open Windows and go back to the Desktop.

                    </font> <b>A.</b>Yes but you will either need two daisy chained 
                    joy pads (they need to be the same make - Plus you need Win98) 
                    or one joystick/pad plugged into the Game port (on the back 
                    of the soundcard) and one plugged into a USB port (this normally 
                    requires an adapter). You cannot use two joysticks plugged 
                    into the Game port via a cable splitter.<br>

                    </font> <b>A.</b>Some graphics cards cannot directly support 
                    the transparent effects that Racers uses; instead, they fake 
                    it. The grainy graphics are the result of a graphics card 
                    attempting to fake transparencies. Contact the manufacturer 
                    of your PC's video card to obtain the latest drivers to see 
                    if this resolves the problem.<br>

                    </font> <b>A.</b>Some graphics cards cannot even fake the 
                    transparency effect (see above) instead they put a black block 
                    on screen where the transparency should be. Contact the manufacturer

                    layout. Try using the Numeric keypad for the directional buttons; 
                    this seems to fix the problem. If not try using one of the

                    If this does not cure the problem then there is a chance that

                    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font color="#006600"><b>DirectX</b></font><br>
                    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If a game has been designed to work under the system and DirectX 
                    is not working or installed properly on your PC then you may 
                    experience strange errors or poor game performance. To resolve 
                    this you will need to make sure that DirectX has been installed 
                    properly and that all drivers on your PC are compatible, and 
                    if possible, certified for that version of DirectX.<br>
                    <br>
                    If you have a PC with Windows 98 on it you will probably find 
                    that DirectX 6 is already installed; if you have Windows 95 
                    you may find that one of the games you have used has installed 
                    DirectX 5 or 6 for you. The latest version of DirectX can 
                    also be downloaded from Microsoft's website ( <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/DirectX" target="_blank">www.microsoft.com/DirectX</a> ).<br>
                    <br>
                    The latest version of DirectX - that was available when this 
                    game was released- is included on the CD. An older version 
                    of DirectX will not overwrite a newer one. So, if you install 
                    a game which uses a version of DirectX older than the one 
                    currently installed on your PC then the DirectX drivers that 
                    your system is using will not be updated.<br>

                    is installed on my PC?</font><br>
                    The procedure for checking which version of DirectX is being 
                    run is the same for Windows 95 and 98. You can check to see 
                    that DirectX is correctly installed by:<br>
                    Double-click on the MY COMPUTER icon<br>
                    Double-click on the C: drive<br>
                    Double-click on the PROGRAM FILES folder<br>
                    Double-click on the DIRECTX folder<br>
                    Double-click on the SETUP folder<br>
                  <li>If you have DirectX 5, you should 
                    see DXINFO, DXSETUP, and DXTOOL.<br>
                  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you have DirectX 
                    5.2, there will be no DXTOOLS, just DXSETUP and DXINFO.<br>
                    </font>
                  </font> 
                  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you 
                    have DirectX6.1, you should see DXINFO, DXSETUP, DXTOOL and DXDIAG.<br>
                    <br>
                    NOTE: Remember DirectX 6.1 is required for LEGO Racers, if 
                    you do not have it installed you should refer to your Technical 
                    Reference manual for installation instructions. Also if your 
                    SETUP folder does not contain any of the above files then 
                    DirectX is probably corrupted or incorrectly installed on 
                    your system. To correct this you may need to contact your 
                    computer vendor for technical support.</font><font face="arial, geneva" size="2"><br>

                    <font face="arial, geneva" size="2"><font color="#006600">OK, so how do I check my drivers? </font><br>
                    DirectX 6. 1<br>
                   <br>
                    Double-click on DXDIAG in the SETUP folder.  The screen that appears has 
                    multiple tabs along the top.  Click on the DirectX drivers' tab.  In this window you 
                    will see a table of devices and their version numbers.  Look in the notes box at the 
                    bottom if it says 'No problems found" then you should be OK, but if it tells you that a 
                    file or files are uncertified then you'll need to get certified and/or compatible drivers 
                    for that device either from your computer vendor or from the card manufacturer's website.  
                    You can check the status of your graphics driver and audio driver by looking under the 
                    Display tab and the Sound tab.<br> 
                    <br>
                    NOTE:  Even if all of your drivers say certified, they could still be causing you issues 
                    due to the fact that they need to be updated.  This can also be resolved by getting updated 
                    certified and/or compatible drivers from the card manufacturer's website or your computer vendor.<br>
