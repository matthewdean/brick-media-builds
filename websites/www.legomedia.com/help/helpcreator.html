<b>Q.</b> LEGO Creator does not work properly on my system.  Do I meet the minimum system requirements to run the software?<br>
</font>
<b>A.</b> The minimum system requirements are as follows:<br>
<ul>
	<li>Win95/98<br>
	<li>Pentium 166mhz with MMX or equivalent<br>
	<li>32MB RAM<br>
	<li>6x speed CD-ROM drive<br>
	<li>85MB of free hard drive after installation<br>
	<li>Direct 3D compatible graphics card capable of 800x600 in 16-bit color<br>
	<li>DirectSound compatible sound card<br>
	<li>Mouse<br>
	<li>Typical install takes approximately 25MB<br>
	<li>Full install takes 200MB+ (includes tutorials)<br>
</ul>

<br>
<font color="#006600">
<b>Q.</b> Why do I keep getting a message telling me I require 800x600 with 16-bit color?<br>
</font>
<b>A.</b> Currently your display settings are not set high enough.  To change your display settings you need to:<br>
<dir>
Click on START<br>
Click on SETTINGS<br>
Click on CONTROL PANEL<br>
Double-click on DISPLAY<br>
Select the SETTINGS tab<br>
</dir>
The COLORS MUST be set for HIGH COLOR (16-bit) and not just 16 color.  Also make sure that your screen size is not set for 640x480 pixels.  It should be set to at least 800x600 pixels.<br>

<b>Q.</b> The LEGO Creator CD has been placed in the drive but nothing happens.<br>
</font>
<b>A.</b> Your PC may not be set to "auto-run" the CD.  The back-up method is to double click the 'My Computer' icon on the Windows desktop, select the CD drive, select Creator and double-click the file Setup.exe in that folder. It should also be noted that CD drives have a certain "spin-up" time, so it is quite normal to wait 10-15 seconds after inserting the CD in the drive before anything happens.<br>
</td></tr></table>

<br>
<font color="#006600">
<b>Q.</b> The program insists that the CD is not in the drive even though it is.<br>
</font>
<b>A.</b> This may be due to a fault in the copy protection system that has been added to the LEGO Creator CD. If this is happening you will need to contact you local technical support. Details are listed
<a href="helpnumbers.html">here</a>.<br>

<br>
<font color="#006600">
<b>Q.</b> The installation starts properly but fails before completion (i.e.) before reaching 100%.<br>
</font>
<b>A.</b> The potential causes and solutions are as follows:<br>
<br>
<li>Early Windows 95 Version<br>
This is a known problem affecting users with early versions of Windows95. To find out which revision of Windows95 you are running click the Start button and select Settings, Control Panel, System.  Under the tab entitled General there should be a description of the system that includes the version of Windows being run.  If this version number ends with the letter 'a' then it is definitely an early version. The solution is to install Microsoft Internet Explorer Version 3.0 or above onto the PC. This is widely available on demonstration disks and can be downloaded from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990508123129/http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/download/windows.htm">here</a>.

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990508123129/http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/download/windows.htm"><img src="/images/msexplorer.gif" width="88" height="31" border="0" align="top" hspace="0" vspace="8"></a>
<br>
This can be uninstalled after Creator has been installed.<br>
<br>
<li>Incorrect Screen Resolution<br>
The desktop resolution may not be high enough to perform the installation.  Check that the desktop is set to High Color (16-bit) and a size of 800x600 or larger.  These settings can be found by right-clicking the Windows desktop and selecting Properties from the bottom of the menu. To make the color and size adjustments left-click on the Settings tab.<br>

<br>
<font color="#006600">
<b>Q.</b> My PC stops on a White Screen.<br>
After selecting the Creator icon from the desktop, a white screen appears and the PC hangs up.<br>
</font>
<b>A.</b> The problem may be due to the faulty copy protection system that has been added to some copies of the LEGO Creator CD. You will need to contact our <a href="helpnumbers.html">technical support</a>. It may also be possible to work around this problem by ejecting the CD when the white screen appears and re-inserting it straight away.  Even if this works, it is recommended that you still contact
<a href="helpnumbers.html">technical support</a>.<br><br>


<font color="#006600">
<b>Q.</b> Creator does not finish loading.<br>
The loading screen with the juggling wizard appears, but the program takes a long time to load, or does not load at all.<br>
</font>
<b>A.</b> LEGO Creator is a large program, so it may take 1-2 minutes to load.  If it is not loading after this period of time, there are a number of possible faults, as listed below:<br>
<br>
<li>Launching Multiple Copies of LEGO Creator.<br>
It is possible you may have launched a second copy of LEGO Creator, 
by double-clicking more than once on the Windows desktop icon.  
This can be tested by ensuring that the you double-click only once 
on the icon (or select the LEGO Creator option once from the Start menu) 
and allowing the program at least two minutes to load.<br>
<br>
<li>Insufficient 3D hardware acceleration.<br>
The graphics hardware acceleration may be insufficient for displaying the 3D part of LEGO Creator. One solution is to disable 3D hardware acceleration by selecting Start, Settings, Control Panel, Add/Remove Programs and choosing the Install/Uninstall tab.  You should then select the DirectX Drivers option from the menu and click on the Add/Remove button.  Then ensure that the Direct3D Hardware Acceleration tick-box is blank before pressing OK.<br>
<br>
<li>Insufficient Memory.<br>
The PC may have less than 32MB RAM, in which case it is below the minimum specification or it might have other memory-intensive programs running simultaneously.  Please should ensure that no other programs are running 
before LEGO Creator is launched.  You should also check that you have at least 100MB of hard disk space free, as lack of such space may also cause the program to run slowly.<br>

<font color="#006600">
<b>Q.</b> LEGO Creator is running slowly.<br>
LEGO Creator runs very slowly, with the 3D world being jerky and the response to clicking on buttons sluggish.<br>
</font>
<b>A.</b> There are a number of possible causes and solutions, as described below:<br>
<br>
<li>PC specification.<br>
Your PC specification may be below the minimum 166MHz recommended, or you may have less than 32MB RAM.  It should be noted that some processors have no internal cache, and this can adversely affect the performance of 3D graphics.  <br>
<br>
<li>DirectX may not be installed.<br>
This can be tested by exiting LEGO Creator and double-clicking the My Computer icon on the desktop and selecting the CD drive (this should contain the LEGO Creator CD).  The user should then select the DirectX folder and double-click on the file Setup.exe file, and follow the subsequent instructions until DirectX is installed. The machine should then be re-started.<br>

<br>
<font color="#006600">
<b>Q.</b> Navigation is too fast.<br>
Navigating the world is too sensitive and fast.<br>
</font>
<b>A.</b> Faster PC's may require a reduction of the navigation sensitivity.  This can be done by adjusting the slider in the Tools menu to a slower setting (indicated by the minifigure animation).<br>

<br>
<font color="#006600">
<b>Q.</b> I can't switch LEGO Creator to hardware mode?<br>
It is not possible to switch the program into hardware mode.  The mode button stays on Software even when clicked with the mouse.<br>
</font>
<b>A.</b> There are a number of possible causes, as described below:<br>
<br>
<li>Wrong colour depth.<br>
You should ensure that the Windows desktop is set to High Color (16-bit) (known alternatively as 32000 or "High") colour resolution. Typically, graphics cards will not support higher colour resolutions. The colour resolution setting can be found by right-clicking the Windows desktop and selecting Properties from the bottom of the menu. Colour adjustment is located within the Settings tab.<br>
<br>
<li>Graphics card does not support windowed modes.<br>
Graphics cards based on certain chip-sets (e.g.) Voodoo do not provide 3D graphics acceleration in windowed modes. LEGO Creator cannot make use of these cards, and will simply behave as though they don't exist. You will be restricted to software mode, unless you install a 2D/3D card that does support 3D graphics acceleration in a windowed mode.<br>
<br>
<li>Graphics card has insufficient memory.<br>
Older graphics cards that would provide 3D graphics acceleration in a windowed environment might not have enough video memory to display the 3D world in LEGO Creator.  It should be mentioned that setting the Windows desktop to 800x600 screen resolution will minimize the amount of Video memory required by the graphics card. However, if even this amount is too much, the program will be restricted to running in software mode.<br>
