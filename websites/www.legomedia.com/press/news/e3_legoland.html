LONDON, May 1999 - LEGO Media International - who develop, publish and market media products for children between the ages of two and sixteen - has announced LEGOLAND� - a park design and management game based on the LEGOLAND Parks and due for release in October this year.  This game enables children aged six upwards to design, construct and run their own virtual park, featuring the main attractions from all three parks including recently opened LEGOLAND California.
<p>

LEGOLAND - part of LEGO Media's LEGO Games range - is a visually striking and challenging game where children can have fun developing their ideal park.  It is graphically very exciting, fresh and colorful with a multitude of fun animations and details to discover. Using LEGO SYSTEM&#153; Western, Pirates, Adventures and Castle themes, it includes a system of encouragement and reward geared towards teaching children aspects of good park design.  There are a wide variety of activities - from creative design and construction to logical problem solving.   
<p>

The game - being developed by UK based developer Krisalis for the PC - is effectively divided into two main parts: Free Play Mode and Game Mode.  In Free Play Mode, children are given access to many, but not all of the LEGOLAND items and can build their own LEGOLAND Park.
<p>

The LEGOLAND attractions include everything you'd expect to see, such as Miniland (a magical area at the heart of the Park featuring scaled LEGO� models of famous towns, cities, and ports), the Driving School (where children negotiate traffic lights and pedestrian crossings), Wild West shows and the Castle (complete with its themed roller-coaster ride). 
<p>

<b>Keeping visitors happy</b><p>

'Game Mode' provides a level-based, goal-driven playing experience that gives children objectives that need to be completed before progressing to the next more challenging level.  Each mini-figure entering the park will earn the player money.  This can be used to purchase new attractions - which become bigger and more expensive as children progress.
<p>

Attractions need to be placed in their own themed areas and children need to ensure the park is both logically 'zoned' and visually appealing.  Mini-figure Helper characters are on hand to offer advice on building and maintaining an attractive and successful park.
<p>

Rewards are built into the game to ensure that success is recognized and there is an on-going reason to continue playing.  These rewards include animations; special sculptures that accumulate as the park becomes more successful, and Minilands, that are awarded for the completion of each level.
