LEGO Media International was formed to take the children's media market one step further - building on the natural fit between LEGO<sup>&#174;</sup> play materials and media products.  <p>
Interactive software is
       LEGO Media's initial focus area with a software range encompassing three strategic areas: LEGO Games&#153;, LEGO Constructive&#153; and LEGO Learning&#153;.  <p>
Each category is designed to provide
       children with a stimulating experience that explores and extends their sense of discovery, intellect and creativity.
