DS2023 Cosmic Daydreams
==============

![](ds2023-cosmic-daydreams.png)

Notes
-----
- The front parts of the speakers appear light bluish gray in the instructions but are actually metallic silver as evidenced by the cover image
- As of this writing (2023-11-08), Studio does not have a [Torso Space Classic Moon with Light Gold Outline Pattern](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=973pb4514) so I've used the nearest substitute
- Two pieces that compose the moonrock are incorrectly shown as colliding due to inaccurate dimensions on one of the pieces

Buildability
------------
- The piece count matches what is shown on the set cover card, assuming each minifigure midsection (torso, hands, and arms) is counted as one piece
